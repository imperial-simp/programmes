disciplines, in a program that ranks as the top aeronautics course in the UK and one of the best World-wide. This is done through an integrated programme of study wherein the specific engineering disciplines are learnt from the first week of the first year; we strongly believe that this is the most appropriate approach to train highly-competitive engineers in the 21st century, and as such the degree programme does not include a general engineering foundation.", "We also aim to graduate students of the highest quality, who will not only demonstrate technical and professional leadership in their fields, but who are adaptable and therefore well-suited to careers in both the industrial and service sectors. Our students must demonstrate both knowledge and skills and apply them to problems relevant to modern engineering practice in both general terms and in discipline-specific terms.", "The programme aims/objectives are to:", " To provide students with a solid technical basis in all the key areas of the modern discipline-specific Engineering profession through delivery of a coherent, coordinated and balanced degree course, integrating core engineering science with practical application.", " To enable students to acquire a mature appreciation of the context in which engineering projects are developed.", " To develop in our students excellence in oral, written and graphical communication.", " To invest graduates with a fitness to enter professional practice and the capacity to have a beneficial impact upon it, whether in the industrial or service sectors generally or in the specific engineering discipline in particular.", " To develop an understanding of the physical world and of the use of mathematical abstraction to represent it.", " To develop the ability to make rational decisions.", " To develop clarity and style in professional communication.", " To develop skills of management, planning, organisation and teamwork.", " To appreciate the conceptual and creative aspects of design; to develop the ability to incorporate concepts into the design of new products or processes.", " To develop an awareness of the place of the individual in business, society and the environment.", " To develop a commitment to the public interest.", " To inculcate an understanding of professional behaviour.", " To develop the intellectual capacity and breadth of vision to remain a learner for life.", "The department maintains very close contact with industry through a joint academic-industry advisory board that was specifically constituted to provide input to the structure and syllabus of the programme. Members of the board include key academics from within the department (Head of Department, Director of Undergraduate Studies, Careers Advisor plus several others) and senior members from a wide variety of UK engineering companies that are influential in the aerospace sector and that might constitute career destinations for the student cohort (Airbus, ARA, BMT Fluid Mechanics Ltd, BAE Systems, QinetiQ, Rolls-Royce, Mercedes AMG F1, Jaguar Land Rover). Detailed syllabus information is reviewed on a regular basis by the board, and, twice yearly, meetings are held at which a series of prepared papers on the state and future direction of both industry and academia are presented and discussed. The ideas generated at these meetings are transferred back into the department via its various strategic committees.", "Contact between students and industry occurs through talks and seminars, specific lecture courses, and projects. For more general talks, a number of visiting industrial speakers are invited each year to present either short lunch-time talks to all undergraduates on their experiences. For specific areas, an industrial speaker may provide a talk to add complementary material to a particular lecture course (e.g. energy and environment in propulsion). Courses in Helicopter Dynamics, Applications of Fluid Dynamics, Structural Dynamics and Design of Experiments are taught in full or in part by industry experts. Input from industry into project work is significant, where undergraduate students benefit in many cases from working with internationally leading engineering companies (normally at their sites) across a broad span of areas. This enables our students to undertake significant project work in demanding areas, either internally or on external placements, which constitutes one of the most significant drivers of our curriculum. Students in placements for a final-year project will be assigned an academic supervisor to monitor their learning experience and also to provide progress feedback and expert advice."]}, "Document_Title": ["MEng Aeronautical Engineering (H401)"]}', '2016-11-12 13:24:51', '2016-11-22 15:39:24', 3, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, NULL, '2016-11-12 12:59:48', '2016-11-22 15:39:24'),

disciplines, in a program that ranks as the top aeronautics course in the UK and one of the best World-wide. This is done through an integrated programme of study wherein the specific engineering disciplines are learnt from the first week of the first year; we strongly believe that this is the most appropriate approach to train highly-competitive engineers in the 21st century, and as such the degree programme does not include a general engineering foundation.", "We also aim to graduate students of the highest quality, who will not only demonstrate technical and professional leadership in their fields, but who are adaptable and therefore well-suited to careers in both the industrial and service sectors. Our students must demonstrate both knowledge and skills and apply them to problems relevant to modern engineering practice in both general terms and in discipline-specific terms. Students in the MEng with a Year Abroad do also benefit from the direct international experience obtained through a year in a foreign university.", "The programme aims/objectives are to:", " To provide students with a solid technical basis in all the key areas of the modern discipline-specific Engineering profession through delivery of a coherent, coordinated and balanced degree course, integrating core engineering science with practical application.", " To enable students to acquire a mature appreciation of the context in which engineering projects are developed.", " To develop in our students excellence in oral, written and graphical communication.", " To invest graduates with a fitness to enter professional practice and the capacity to have a beneficial impact upon it, whether in the industrial or service sectors generally or in the specific engineering discipline in particular.", " To develop an understanding of the physical world and of the use of mathematical abstraction to represent it.", " To develop the ability to make rational decisions.", " To develop clarity and style in professional communication.", " To develop skills of management, planning, organisation and teamwork.", " To appreciate the conceptual and creative aspects of design; to develop the ability to incorporate concepts into the design of new products or processes.", " To develop an awareness of the place of the individual in business, society and the environment.", " To develop a commitment to the public interest.", " To inculcate an understanding of professional behaviour.", " To develop the intellectual capacity and breadth of vision to remain a learner for life.", "The department maintains very close contact with industry through a joint academic-industry advisory board that was specifically constituted to provide input to the structure and syllabus of the programme. Members of the board include key academics from within the department (Head of Department, Director of Undergraduate Studies, Careers Advisor plus several others) and senior members from a wide variety of UK engineering companies that are influential in the aerospace sector and that might constitute career destinations for the student cohort (Airbus, ARA, BMT Fluid Mechanics Ltd, BAE Systems, QinetiQ, Rolls-Royce, Mercedes AMG F1, Jaguar Land Rover). Detailed syllabus information is reviewed on a regular basis by the board, and, twice yearly, meetings are held at which a series of prepared papers on the state and future direction of both industry and academia are presented and discussed. The ideas generated at these meetings are transferred back into the department via its various strategic committees.", "Contact between students and industry occurs through talks and seminars, specific lecture courses, and projects. For more general talks, a number of visiting industrial speakers are invited each year to present either short lunch-time talks to all undergraduates on their experiences. For specific areas, an industrial speaker may provide a talk to add complementary material to a particular lecture course (e.g. energy and environment in propulsion). Courses in Helicopter Dynamics, Applications of Fluid Dynamics, Structural Dynamics and Design of Experiments are taught in full or in part by industry experts. Input from industry into project work is significant, where undergraduate students benefit in many cases from working with internationally leading engineering companies (normally at their sites) across a broad span of areas. This enables our students to undertake significant project work in demanding areas, either internally or on external placements, which constitutes one of the most significant drivers of our curriculum. Students in placements for a final-year project will be assigned an academic supervisor to monitor their learning experience and also to provide progress feedback and expert advice."]}, "Document_Title": ["MEng Aeronautical Engineering with a Year Abroad"]}', '2016-11-12 13:24:51', '2016-11-22 15:37:26', 3, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, NULL, '2016-11-12 12:59:48', '2016-11-22 15:37:26'),

disciplines, in a program that ranks as the top aeronautics course in the UK and one of the best World-wide. This is done through an integrated programme of study wherein the specific engineering disciplines are learnt from the first week of the first year; we strongly believe that this is the most appropriate approach to train highly-competitive engineers in the 21st century, and as such the degree programme does not include a general engineering foundation.", "We also aim to graduate students of the highest quality, who will not only demonstrate technical and professional leadership in their fields, but who are adaptable and therefore well-suited to careers in both the industrial and service sectors. This is the particularly relevant in the MEng in Aeronautical Engineering with a Year in Industry, for students that arrange an internship with a relevant company for a full year during their studies. Our students must demonstrate both knowledge and skills and apply them to problems relevant to modern engineering practice in both general terms and in discipline-specific terms.", "The programme aims/objectives are to:", " To provide students with a solid technical basis in all the key areas of the modern discipline-specific Engineering profession through delivery of a coherent, coordinated and balanced degree course, integrating core engineering science with practical application.", " To enable students to acquire a mature appreciation of the context in which engineering projects are developed.", " To develop in our students excellence in oral, written and graphical communication.", " To invest graduates with a fitness to enter professional practice and the capacity to have a beneficial impact upon it, whether in the industrial or service sectors generally or in the specific engineering discipline in particular.", " To develop an understanding of the physical world and of the use of mathematical abstraction to represent it.", " To develop the ability to make rational decisions.", " To develop clarity and style in professional communication.", " To develop skills of management, planning, organisation and teamwork.", " To appreciate the conceptual and creative aspects of design; to develop the ability to incorporate concepts into the design of new products or processes.", " To develop an awareness of the place of the individual in business, society and the environment.", " To develop a commitment to the public interest.", " To inculcate an understanding of professional behaviour.", " To develop the intellectual capacity and breadth of vision to remain a learner for life.", "The department maintains very close contact with industry through a joint academic-industry advisory board that was specifically constituted to provide input to the structure and syllabus of the programme. Members of the board include key academics from within the department (Head of Department, Director of Undergraduate Studies, Careers Advisor plus several others) and senior members from a wide variety of UK engineering companies that are influential in the aerospace sector and that might constitute career destinations for the student cohort (Airbus, ARA, BMT Fluid Mechanics Ltd, BAE Systems, QinetiQ, Rolls-Royce, Mercedes AMG F1, Jaguar Land Rover). Detailed syllabus information is reviewed on a regular basis by the board, and, twice yearly, meetings are held at which a series of prepared papers on the state and future direction of both industry and academia", "are presented and discussed. The ideas generated at these meetings are transferred back into the department via its various strategic committees.", "Contact between students and industry occurs through talks and seminars, specific lecture courses, and projects. For more general talks, a number of visiting industrial speakers are invited each year to present either short lunch-time talks to all undergraduates on their experiences. For specific areas, an industrial speaker may provide a talk to add complementary material to a particular lecture course (e.g. energy and environment in propulsion). Courses in Helicopter Dynamics, Applications of Fluid Dynamics, Structural Dynamics and Design of Experiments are taught in full or in part by industry experts. Input from industry into project work is significant, where undergraduate students benefit in many cases from working with internationally leading engineering companies (normally at their sites) across a broad span of areas. This enables our students to undertake significant project work in demanding areas, either internally or on external placements, which constitutes one of the most significant drivers of our curriculum. Finally, students can arrange year-long internships in relevant industrial companies as part of the Year in Industry degree.

The second year builds upon the first year to provide a platform for specialisation.", "Practical skills (that complement technical modules) are gained in the first two years in the context of wet and dry laboratories. Design, test and build activities start in the first year, and group working is introduced in fresher\'s week, as collaboration in interdisciplinary teams is a key feature of working as a professional Biomedical Engineer. The second year includes a substan tial group project. Broader issues such as Ethics are also covered.", "In the first two years all modules are compulsory and are delivered in the department. Thereafter students may elect to take some modules in other departments of the Faculty of Engineerin g. Our students attend the same lectures and take the same assessments as the senior year students in the hosting department. This confirms that the first two years have provided a solid platform for specialisation. The knowledge, understanding and skills acquired throughout the Faculty will be translated into a Bioengineering themed final year individual project.", "After two years of compulsory courses (taught in-house) progression on to the third year of the MEng course requires an overall mark of at least 60%. The Director of Courses has the discretion to condone a near miss to this requirement. Otherwise, students are obliged to move to the third year of the BEng programme. The MEng programme has three pathways: Electrical Engineering,", "Mechanical Engineer ing and Bioengineering. The pathway choice determines the modules that are compulsory and a set of optional modules. However, there is still scope to take optional modules outside the pathway.", "Students entering the final year have no courses that are com pulsory, but can choose all of their courses. This allows them to follow the topics that may have caught their interest, or for them to keep their options open. Much of the final year is spent on their individual project, and this is reflected in the mark weighting of the project."]}, "Document_Title": ["MEng Biomedical Engineering"]}', '2016-11-12 13:24:51', '2016-11-22 16:00:39', 3, 1, 1, 2, 6, 1, NULL, '2016-11-12 12:59:48', '2016-11-22 16:00:39'),

Students spend their third year studying at a partner institution in France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy or Spain, undertaking a substantial project (at Masters level) and a selection of locally provided modules. Returning to Imperial in Year 4, students have access to a wide range of elective modules providing either a broad physics educatio n or specialisation in particular areas of physics up to Masters level standard (FHEQ Level 7). The programme aims to prepare students for the transition to postgraduate study in physics or a career as a professional physicist, enhanced by having lived and studied in another country."]}, "Document_Title": ["MSc i Physics with a Year in Europe"]}', '2016-11-12 13:24:55', '2016-11-22 11:43:32', 3, 1, 3, 20, 9, 1, NULL, '2016-11-12 12:59:49', '2016-11-22 11:43:32'),

The undergraduate teaching office repeatedly informs individual staff via email when coursework is due back at the appropriate time. The Director of Undergraduate Studies routinely monitors the quality and quantity of feedback provided on marked coursework. In some instances, generic class feedback is returned to all students via email or a Blackboard announcement once coursework is marked.", "Mitigating_Circumstances_Policy": "http://www.imperial.ac.uk/registry/exams"}, "Assessment_Structure": {"Marking_Scheme": ["Regulation of Assessment", "Minimum pass mark is 40% overall for each course module, which must include a mark of at least", "35% in the coursework component and a mark of at least 35% in the examination.", "For course modules that include a written examination, coursework typically contributes 20- 25% of the total marks available.
